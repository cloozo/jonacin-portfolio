## Jonacin Pierre-Louis Portfolio - 2021
---

## During the course of this assignment, I have used many ressoures which include but are not limited to mdn documentation,
momentjs, fontawesome icons, google api, CDN documentation.


* When someone click on the different sections of my site, it helps navigate them to the “home page”,
 “About me”, “Portfolio”,  “Contact” sections of the page.

* I created an online link to my portfolio using HTML, CSS. From the lessons I learned in class and other searches that I have done online,I was able to create this website  from scratch and it aims to show sample of my work to potential employers.
In different sections of the site, one can see my name, a recent photo of me, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.


## Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:

 I have used HTML5 semantic tags to help those who are visually impaired navigate through the page and the ALT attribute for image description. Also, the site is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to user's  viewport. In addition, Semantic Tage are added and emantic HTML tags  help provided additional information that helps Google and Bing understand the roles and relative importance of the different parts of the page

 Overall, it was a great learning experience and this activity has helped me greatly advanced in my road to becoming a web developper.

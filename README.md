#This file contains my online portfolio which has a link via GitHub of my work


Resources used for the site:

HTML5, CSS, FONT AWESOME, GOOGLE FONT
I created an online link to my portfolio using HTML, CSS. From the lessons I learned in class and other searches that I have done online,I was able to create this website  from scratch and it aims to show sample of my work to potential employers.
In different sections of the site, one can see my name, a recent photo of me, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

When someone click on the different sections of my site, it helps navigate them to the “home page”,
 “About me”, “Portfolio”,  “Contact” sections of the page.

 I have used HTML5 semantic tags to help those who visually impaired navigate through the link and the ALT attribute for image description. Also, the site presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.

Thank You.
